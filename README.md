# HOUSING PREDICTION IN INDIA
About the Project 
In this project, I worked with a dataset with 14,621 properties for sale in India through the data set on real estate from kaggle.com. We transition from descriptive to predictive data science. My focus is still real estate, but then i need to create a machine learning model that predicts apartment prices in India using the dataset.
My goal is to determine whether sale prices are influenced more by property size or location.

Some of the things i did in this project are:
- Organizing information using basic Python data structures.
- Data import from CSV files and cleaning it using the pandas library.
- Created some interesting  data visualizations like scatter and box plots.
- Examined the relationship between variables using various means.
- Created a linear regression model using the scikit-learn library.
- Built a data pipeline for imputing missing values and encoding categorical features.
- Improved model performance by reducing overfitting.
